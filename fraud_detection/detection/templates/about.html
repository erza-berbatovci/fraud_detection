        <h1>About Fraud Detection</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Fraud Detection Application. This tool is designed to help detect fraudulent transactions
            using advanced machine learning algorithms.</p>

        <h2>Purpose of the Application</h2>
        <p>This application uses anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns in financial transactions. It
            aims to prevent fraud by analyzing transactional data and highlighting anomalies.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> The uploaded dataset is analyzed for missing values, class distribution,
                and key metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> The Isolation Forest algorithm is used to train the model, which
                isolates anomalies based on their unique patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Results are presented through scatter plots, pie charts, and detailed
                statistics to aid in better understanding.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>About the Algorithms</h2>
        <p><strong>Isolation Forest:</strong> This is an unsupervised anomaly detection method that identifies anomalies
            by splitting the data hierarchically. Anomalies are isolated faster because they are less frequent and
            different from normal data.</p>
        <p><strong>Cross-Validation:</strong> A method used to evaluate the model's performance by dividing the dataset
            into multiple folds for training and testing.</p>

        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>This application was developed by <strong>Erza</strong>, as part of a thesis focused on fraud detection using
            AI-based algorithms. It combines data science, Django, and machine learning to deliver a user-friendly
            experience.</p>
